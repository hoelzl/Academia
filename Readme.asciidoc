Test Environment for the `Academia` Example
===========================================

This is a test environment to demonstrate a system that combines
"intelligent" agents using reinforcement learning with Poem/ALisp and
"dumb" agents implemented in Lua.  The Lua agents can receive updates
of their behavior from the intelligent ones via the Hexameter
protocol.  Therefore we call the Poem agents _teachers_, the Lua
agents _students_.
